# KORG_DS_8_SysEx
## Reader of SysEx-files (\*.syx) from the old 4-Op FM-Synth Korg DS-8
I started this project in summer 2012, when I had problems with my old synth.
In the early days of MIDI, System-Exclusive-Data (Sys-Ex / syx) was the only way 
to share sounds between different synths, at least of the same synth model. 
It seems that there is no standard for sysex files. It was pretty hard to read 
all bits in the right order. Until now I do not know if every bit will be read 
correctly. So the program never made it to a syx-writer, but anymay, it helped 
me out to solve my DS-8-problems. If you love vintage gear like I do, you could 
take this little project as a starting point for your own ideas.
